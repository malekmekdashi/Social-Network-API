  ## Description
  This week's homework assignment asks us to build a social network api that includes a user, their thoughts, reactions and friends. To build this API, we first need to install our dependancies which include express and mongoose. After running 'npm i' in terminal, we then run the command 'npm run start' to run the server on the localhost. This assignment is backend with no front end component, so we will be using insomnia to test our api routes. We are told to create a username with an email. This new user, is able to add friends, create thoughts, and even reactions. The user is also able to update and remove either their thoughts, friends, or reactions.
